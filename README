Tools

huobj          -- Converts HuOBJ .o files into more common files (eventually an
                  ELF object, but for now it dumps all the sections).
hulib          -- Extracts files from HuLIB .a files into a directory for usage.
pcfx-cdlink    -- An updated version of pcfx-cdlink that allows you to generate
                  a set of .bin and .cue files which can be burned and then run
                  on a PC-FX. Uses an input list with parameters for
                  configuration. (example.txt is an example of such an input
                  list file.) boot.h may not be legal within your jurisdiction,
                  as it is a binary blob taken from a commercial game.
